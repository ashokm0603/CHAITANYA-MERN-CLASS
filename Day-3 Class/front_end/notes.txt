React: 
------
    ->small JS Library 
    ->Component Based 
    ->virtual DOM
    ->Using React we build SPA(single page Applications )


We Create React APP : 
    1. CLI (Command line Interface )
        ->Sample react app (using npx )  -npx create-react-app app_name
        ->React+vite (using Npm)         -npm create vite@latest


    2. CDN (Content Delivery network )



Components in React : 
----------------------
    ->Smallest UI Blocks in web page is called as Components
    ->Types of Components : 
        1. Class based Components 
                ->here we can declared class based Components using "class" 
                ->class based Components are stateful
                ->CBC contains this keyword , super keyword , render method and life cycle methods 


        2. function based Components 
                ->This Components declared using Function (arrow function, functional expression) 
                ->FBC is stateless Component 
                ->FBC not contains this keyword , super keyword , render method , life cycle methods  not present 

JSX(javascript and XML ):
    ->File name starts with uppercase
    ->JSX will support javascript expression {}
    ->JSX file will contains both html, js code
    ->JSX supports empty fragments <> </>
    ->If JSX return multiple html tags , we need to write all tags in one parent tag  

States : 
---------
    ->State is used to hold the value or data 
    ->state are mutable
    
In FBC states : 
---------------
    ->in react version 16.8  hooks are introduce
    ->hooks are to make FBC is stateful 
    ->hooks are present only in FBC 
    ->Ex: useState() , useNavigate() , useContext() , useMemo() , useEffect()...etc 


Props : 
------
    ->Props are used transfer data from one Component to another another Component 
    ->props are immutable
    ->React unidirectional Data flow
